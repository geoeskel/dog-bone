                        <h2>How Often Should I Feed My Dog?</h2>
                        Set mealtimes are recommended for most dogs for a variety of reasons. Keeping mealtimes consistent, as well as the type and amount of food you feed him, will help him maintain both his digestive health and his weight. Consistent mealtimes can also help prevent accidents in the house.

                        For most dogs, feeding twice each day—once in the morning and once in the evening—is appropriate.

                        <h2>Why Does My Dog’s Food Amount Matter?</h2>
                        The right kind of nourishment helps keep your dog healthy. Overfeeding your dog can cause weight gain, which can lead to joint problems and other health issues.
                        
                        Keeping portion sizes consistent and appropriate based on his age, weight and activity levels will help him maintain his ideal weight and remain active.
